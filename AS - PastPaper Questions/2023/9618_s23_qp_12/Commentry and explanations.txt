2. Indirect Addressing:
   - Definition: The operand holds a memory address that stores the memory address of the data.
   - Explanation: This mode uses a pointer to reach the data, which adds a step but is useful for data structures like arrays or handling dynamically allocated memory.

3. Immediate Addressing:
   - Definition: The operand is the data.
   - Explanation: Immediate addressing bypasses memory to directly encode the data within the instruction itself, speeding up data access for constants or fixed values.
