The walkthrough method in software testing is a review process where team members, including developers, testers, and sometimes users or stakeholders, go through the code, design, or specifications of a software project to identify errors, improve the quality of the product, and ensure that it meets its objectives. This method is particularly effective for ensuring a shared understanding of the code and design among all team members and for catching issues that automated tests might miss.

During a walkthrough:

- Preparation: Before the meeting, the author of the code or document to be reviewed distributes it to all participants, along with any relevant materials. Participants are expected to review these materials in advance.
- Meeting: The team gathers, often led by the author or a moderator. The code or design is discussed line by line or section by section. Participants ask questions, suggest improvements, and point out potential errors or issues.
- Documentation: Comments, suggestions, and identified issues are documented. This might be done by the author, the moderator, or a designated scribe.
- Action Items: The meeting results in a list of action items, which might include code revisions, additional tests to be written, or design changes. The author is typically responsible for addressing these items.
- Follow-up: After the necessary revisions are made, there may be a follow-up session to ensure all concerns have been addressed satisfactorily.

Walkthroughs are collaborative and educational, aimed not just at finding errors but also at knowledge sharing and consensus-building. They can be applied at various stages of software development, from reviewing requirements and design documents to examining source code.
